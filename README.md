# RESCUE
Renewable Energy Salient Combined Uncertainty Estimator



A machine-learning based framework to quantify the short-term uncertainty in netload forecast developed by E3.

Characteristics includes:
1. Production history, temporal information and recent lag errors aware.
2. Correlation aware as solar,wind, and load errors are co-trained.
3. Produces multiple prediction intervals for expected error in netload forecasting
4. Model agnostic. No requirement on knowledge of the inner workings of the netload forecast
