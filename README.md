# RESCUE
Renewable Energy Salient Combined Uncertainty Estimator

A machine-learning based framework to quantify the short-term uncertainty in netload forecast developed by E3.

Characteristics includes:
1. Weather, time and recent errors aware.
2. Correlation aware as solar,wind, and load errors are co-trained.
3. Produces multiple prediction intervals for expected error in netload forecasting
4. Model agnostic. No requirement on knowledge of the inner workings of the netload forecast

Stay tuned for more details to come.
